## 📚 What I Learned

As a developer, building this project helped me master the following concepts:

1.  **Tailwind CSS Customization:** Learning how to use utility classes for layout (Flexbox/Grid), spacing, and typography without writing custom CSS files.
2.  **Relative Linking:** Solving 404 errors by correctly using relative paths (e.g., `excel.html` instead of absolute URLs) to ensure seamless navigation on GitHub Pages.
3.  **Third-Party Library Integration:** Implementing `AOS.js` to add professional-grade animations with minimal code.
4.  **SEO Fundamentals:** Adding `<meta property="og:...">` tags to ensure the link looks professional when shared on Facebook and Messenger.
5.  **Deployment:** Managing the CI/CD pipeline of GitHub Pages for instant updates.
